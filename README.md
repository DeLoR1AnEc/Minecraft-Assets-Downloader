A simple tool that lets you download assets and data of selected minecraft version.

Use up and down arrow keys for navigation, to search press F and to exit search Esc (also Esc if you want to stop script cus Ctrl+C doesnt work) 

Also make sure that you have python and pip installed and that you downloaded dependencies with
```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script in its directory with
```
py .\main.py
```


Or
```
py .\main.py <version id like 25w05a or 1.21.2-pre1 etc>
```
to download it without navigating scary ascii interface.
